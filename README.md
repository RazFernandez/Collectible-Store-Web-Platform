*End of Part I ‚Äì Context, Vision & Methodology*  
Next: **Part II ‚Äì Architecture, Implementation & Testing (Sprints 1 ‚Äì 3)**  


# üß± Part II ‚Äî Architecture, Implementation & Testing (Sprints 1‚Äì3)

---

## üß© 1. System Architecture

The *Collectibles Store Web Application* was designed following a **modular MVC‚Äëinspired architecture**, promoting code readability, scalability, and separation of concerns. Each layer communicates through well‚Äëdefined interfaces, avoiding tight coupling between components.

### 1.1 Layered Architecture Overview

| Layer | Folder | Responsibilities |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| **Routes / Controllers** | `/routes` | Define REST endpoints, handle requests, and connect services. |
| **Service Layer** | `/service` | Encapsulates business logic and validation. |
| **Repository Layer** | `/repo` | Manages data storage (in‚Äëmemory during sprints). |
| **Domain Layer** | `/domain` | Defines entities (e.g., `Item`, `User`, `Offer`). |
| **WebSocket Layer** | `/ws` | Implements real‚Äëtime broadcast and event handling. |
| **Utilities** | `/util` | Helper functions for JSON serialization and formatting. |

---

### 1.2 Data Flow Diagram

```text
Client (Browser / Postman)
      ‚îÇ
      ‚ñº
 Routes (Spark)
      ‚îÇ
      ‚ñº
 Service Layer
      ‚îÇ
      ‚ñº
 Repository (Map / DB)
```

Requests follow this pipeline:  
1. **Routes** receive HTTP requests.  
2. **Services** validate and process data.  
3. **Repositories** store or retrieve entities.  
4. **Responses** are serialized as JSON using Gson.  

---

### 1.3 Key Components

#### App.java
Entry point of the application, responsible for:  
- Setting port and environment variables.  
- Registering routes and filters.  
- Configuring CORS (for testing).  

```java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        port(Integer.parseInt(System.getenv().getOrDefault("PORT", "4567")));
        before((req, res) -> res.type("application/json"));
        new ItemsRoutes(new ItemService(new ItemRepository())).register();
    }
}
```

#### Json Utility
Centralized JSON handling for responses.  
```java
public class Json {
    private static final Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();
    public static String toJson(Object obj) { return gson.toJson(obj); }
}
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Configuration Files
